## Introduction
This project consists of a question answering (QA) and question generation (QG) system. The system generates n questions (n specified by the user) given a wikipedia article as context. Alternatively, the user can specify n questions created from a wikipedia document, and the question answering system will answer all n questions. The QA system can handle both True/False as well as extractive passage questions


## Running this project
This project can be run by building the docker image specified in the docker folder. Alternatively, the the same docker image can be pulled from its public repository (ads28/submit_v1)
